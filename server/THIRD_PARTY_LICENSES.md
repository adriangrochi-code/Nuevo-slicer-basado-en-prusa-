Licenses as declared in the package metadata (PyPI `License-Expression` / `License`) of the versions tested on
2026-10-20. All of them allow use in proprietary software. None of them is copied into this directory: they are
installed with pip.

psycopg is LGPL-3.0: it is used unmodified as a separately installed library (pip), which the LGPL allows in
proprietary software; if it is ever modified, the modified source must be published. The `tisma-cloud` executable
bundles it (one file): it is built for the machines of the service, not given to anyone. Before giving the executable
to third parties, build it as a folder (PyInstaller "onedir", the psycopg files replaceable) and include the LGPL text.

Programs run as separate processes (not linked):

| Program | License | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Tisma Slicer (`tisma-slicer`, `tisma-fea`) | AGPL-3.0 | The source of the version used by the service, with every change, must stay published (AGPL §13). |
| PostgreSQL 16 | PostgreSQL License | Database (Docker image `postgres:16`). |
| Caddy 2.8 | Apache-2.0 | HTTPS proxy (Docker image `caddy:2.8`). |
| ClamAV 1.5 (optional) | GPL-2.0 | Antivirus of the uploads (Docker image `clamav/clamav:1.5`, `--profile antivirus`); the master only talks to it over its TCP protocol (clamd INSTREAM), nothing is linked. Its signatures come from Cisco Talos under their own terms. |
| LibreTranslate 1.9.6 (optional) | AGPL-3.0 | Translator of the problem reports (Docker image `libretranslate/libretranslate:v1.9.6`, `--profile translate`), unmodified; the master only calls its HTTP API (`POST /translate`), nothing is linked. Its models come from the Argos Translate index: several are derived from OPUS-MT (CC-BY 4.0, credited in the README of each model) and include Stanza models (Apache-2.0); they are downloaded by the container, not distributed with the server. |
| Google Identity Services (`accounts.google.com/gsi/client`) | Google's terms | Loaded by the account page from Google only when `TISMA_GOOGLE_CLIENT_IDS` is set; not distributed with the server. |
