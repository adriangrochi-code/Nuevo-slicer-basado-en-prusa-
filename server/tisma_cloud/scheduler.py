"""The queue: jobs wait in the database and the nodes take them (they are not pushed), so a node that is switched
off does not stop the others.

A node takes the first queued job of the first class of its priority list that has one; within a class, the jobs of
the plans with a higher priority first, then the oldest. On PostgreSQL the row is locked with FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED,
so that nodes claiming at the same time do not wait for each other; the conditional UPDATE (status still queued)
makes the claim safe on any database.

A user may submit a job when the account is enabled, the plan is paid (with a few days of grace), the hours of the
month are not used up and fewer than max_concurrent of its jobs are waiting or running. The time a job runs on a node
is charged to the month when it is done (failed jobs are not charged).
