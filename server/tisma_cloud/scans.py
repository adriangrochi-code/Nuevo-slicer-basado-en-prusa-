"""3D scans of Tisma Scanner (the Android app of the openscanner repository) computed in the cloud.

A scan is a zip of photos and sensor data, from tens of MB to several GB: too large for one request (Cloudflare cuts
requests of more than 100 MB) and sent from a phone, whose connection may drop. So it is sent in pieces, as the app
already did with its own server:

    POST   /v1/scans                     {"size": bytes, "name": "..."}  -> {"id", "chunk_size", "received"}
    PUT    /v1/scans/{id}/data?offset=N  one piece (409 with "received" when the offset is not where it goes on)
    GET    /v1/scans/{id}                what has arrived, and the job when complete
    POST   /v1/scans/{id}/complete       checks the zip and makes the job (kind "scan"): the job of GET /v1/jobs/{id}
    DELETE /v1/scans/{id}                gives up a scan being sent

The job runs on a node with tisma_scan (photogrammetry with COLMAP; node/runners.py) and its result is a zip with the
part in STL (mm), its report and the point cloud. Scans being sent and not touched for a day are removed."""
